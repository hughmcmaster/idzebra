Better ranking in searches. Admin should be able specify initial
 weight to certain fields.

Search result should hold information about hits for each term,
 especially when using ranked search.

Admin should be able to specify set/attr when none is specified
 (currently bib1,use=any is used).

Explain support - including d1 to grs (d1_grs.c) in YAZ; Zebra
 to auto-generate explain information depending on data1 system.

Generic character set mapping (w, p, etc.)

ISAMC optimization: indirect block with pointers to all blocks
 in chain. The initial block should include the count as well.

Test mode fix: when using test mode (-s) Zebra should only do
 read-locking and not write-locking thus preventing Zebra thinking
 the index is inconsistent.
