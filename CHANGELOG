New config setting, followLinks, that controls whether update or files
should follow symbolic. Set it to 1 (for enable) or 0 (to disable).
By default symbolic links are followed.

Fix MARC transfer . MARC fields had wrong data for multiple fields.

XML record reader moved from YAZ to Zebra, to make YAZ less 
dependant on external libraries.

Zebra uses yaz_iconv which is mini iconv library supporting UTF-8,
UCS4, ISO-8859-1. This means that Zebra does UNICODE even
on systems that doesn't offer iconv.

XML record reader supports external system entities.

--- 1.3.1 2002/08/20

New .abs-directive "xpath" that takes one argument: "enable"
or "disable" to enable and disable XPath -indexing. If no "xpath"
direcive is found in .abs-file , XPath-indexing is disabled to ensure
backwards compatibility. For missing .abs-files XPath-indexing is
enabled so that such records are searchable.

Zebra warns about missing .abs-file only once (for each type).

Fixed a bug in file update where already-inserted files could
be treated as "new".

--- 1.3.0 2002/08/05

Zebra license changed to GNU GPL.

XPath-like queries used when RPN string attributes are used, eg.
   @attr 1=/portal/title sometitle
   @attr 1=/portal/title[@xml:lang=da] danishtitle
   @attr 1=/portal/title/@xml:lang da
   @attr 1=//title sometitle

Zebra uses UTF-8 internally:
1) New setting "encoding" for zebra.cfg that specifies encoding for
OCTET terms in queries and record encoding for most transfer syntaxes
(except those that use International Strings, such as GRS-1).
2) The encoding of International strings is UTF-8 by default. It
may be changed by character set negotiation. If character set
negotiation is in effect and if records are selected for conversion
these'll be converted to the selected character set - thus overriding
the encoding setting in zebra.cfg.
3) New directive "encoding" in .abs-files. This specifies the external
character encoding for files indexed by zebra. However, if records
themselves have an XML header that specifies and encoding that'll be used
instead.

XML filter (-t grs.xml).

Multiple registers. New setting in resource 'root' that holds base
directory for register(s). A group a databases may be put in separate
register in directory root/reg by using db name 'reg/db1' ... 'reg/dbN'.

--- 1.1.1 2002/03/21

Fixes for Digital Unix

Implemented hits per term using USR:SearchResult-1.

New Zebra API. Locking system re-implemented.

--- 1.1.stable 2002/02/20

Rank weight can be controlled with attribute type 9. Default
value is 34. Recommended values between 1-36.

--- 1.1 2001/10/25

Updated for YAZ version 1.8.

Added support for termsets - a result set of terms matching
a given query. For @attr 8=<set> creates termset named <set>.

Added support for raw retrieval. Element Set Name R forces the
text filter which returns the record in its original form.

Added numerical sort - triggered by structure=numeric (4=109).

Remote record import using Z39.50 Extended Services and Segments.

Fixed bug where updating a database with user-defined attributes
could corrupt the register (bad storeKeys).

Multi-threaded version.

Fixed bug regarding proximity.

Documentation updates.

Fixed bug in record retrieval module that occured on 64-bit OSF 
architectures.

--- 1.0.1 2000/2/10

Fixed bug in makefile for WIN32.

Fixed bug in configure script - used bash-specific features.

--- 1.0 1999/12/10

Added support for multiple records in one file for filter grs.sgml.

Changed record index structure. New layout is incompatible with
previous releases. Added setting "recordcompression" to control
compression of records. Possible values are "none" (no
compression) and bzip2 (compression using libbz2).

Added XML transfer syntax support for retrieval of structured records.
Schema in CompSpec is recognised in retrieval of structured records.

Changed Tcl record filter so that it attemps to read  <filt>.tflt. If
that fails, the filter reads the file <filt>.flt (regx style filter).

Implemented new Tcl record filter -  use grs.tcl.<filter> to enable it.
Zebra's configure script automatically attempts to locate Tcl. For
manual Tcl configuration use option --with-tclconfig=<path> to specify
where Tcl's library files are located.

Implemented "compression" of Dictionary and ISAM system. Dictionary
format HAS changed.

Added "tagsysno" directive to zebra.cfg to control under which tag the
system ID is placed. Use tagsysno: 0 to disable Zebra's system number
entirely.

Added "tagrank" as above.

Changed file naming scheme for register files from <name>.mf.<no> to
<name>-<no>.mf.

Implemented "position"-flag for register type (as defined in
default.idx). When set to zero no position (or seqence number) is
saved in register for each word occurrence, thus saving some register
space.

Implemented database mapping. Using mapdb one can specify a database
to be mapped to one or more physical databases. Usage:
mapdb <fromdb> <todb> ..

Added SOIF-filter. Thanks to Peter Valkenburg.

For the regx-filter "end element -record" may trigger a mark-of-record
if outer level is reached.

Tag sets may be typed in the reference to it. From the .abs-file the
"tagset" directive takes a third optional integer type for the tag set
referenced. From a .tag-file the "include" directive takes a third
optional type as well. The old "type" directive in the tag set itself
is still recognized but acts as the default type for the tag set.
 
Zebra supports the specification of arbitrary attributes sets, schemas
and tag sets, because of the change in YAZ' OID management system.

Fixed bug in Sort that caused it NOT to use character mapping as it
should.

Zebra now uses GNU configure to generate Makefile(s).

Added un-optimised support for left and left/right truncation attributes.

Added support for relational operators on text when using RPN queries.

Added support for sort specifications in RPN queries. Type 7 specifies
'sort' where value 1=ascending, value 2=descending. The use attribute
specifies the field criteria as usual.  The term specifies priority
where 0=first, 1=second, ...

Changed the way use attributes are specified in the recordId
specification.

Maximum number of databases in one Zebra register increased.

New setting, databasePath, which specifies that first directory during
update traversal is the database name (instead of a fixed one).

New setting, explainDatabase, which specifies that databases are
EXPLAIN aware.

Modified Zebra so that it works with ASN.1 compiled code for YAZ.

Implemented EXPLAIN database maintenance. Zebra automatically
generate - and update CategoryList, TargetInfo, DatabaseInfo,
AttributeSetInfo and AttributeDetails records at this stage. The
records may be transferred as GRS-1, SUTRS or Explain.

Fixed register spec so that colon isn't treated as size separator
unless followed by [0-9+-] in order to allow DOS drive specifications.

Fixed two bugs in ISAMC system.

Changed the way Zebra keeps its maintenance information about attribute
sets, available attributes, etc.. Records in "SGML" notation using an
EXPLAIN schema is now used when appropriate.

Bug fix: Index didn't handle update/insert/delete of the same record
(i.e. same recordId) in one run (one invocation of zebraidx). Only the
first occurence of a record is considered.

Most searches now return correct number of hits.

New modular ranking system. Interested programmers are encouraged to
inspect rank1.c and improve the algorithm.

Bug fix: Lock files weren't removed as they should on NT.

Implemented Z39.50 Sort. Zebra's sort handler uses use attributes to
specify a "sort register". Refer to the gils sample records which refer
to index type "s" which is specified as "sort" in the default.idx file.
Each sort criteria can either be Ascending or Descending and at most
three sort elements can be specified.  

Bug fix: Character mapping didn't work for text files.

--- 1.0b1 1998/1/29

Simple ranked searches now return correct number of hits.

The test option (-s) only makes a read-lock on the index as well
as using read-only operations anywhere.

Moved towards generic character mapping. Configuration file default.idx
specifies character map files for register types w, p, u, etc.

Implemented "begin variant" for the sgml.regx - filter.

Fixed a few memory leaks.

Added support for C++, headers uses extern "C" for public definitions.

Bug fix: The show records facility (-s) only displayed information for
the first record in a file (and not for every record in the file).

Added option "-f <n>" to limit the logging of record operations. After
<n> records has been processed no logging is performed (unless errors
occur).

Bug fix: the compressed ISAM system didn't handle update operations
correctly.

Added setting, "maxResultSetSize", to hold the number of records to 
save in a result set.

Bug fix: Complete phrase did't work for search operations.

Bug fix: temporary result sets weren't deleted.

Reduced disk space for saved keys (storeKeys = 1).

Added optional, physical ANY (key replication)

Implemented proximity operator in search.

Bug fix: the path name buffers used by file match traversal routines
have been extended to support long file names.

New C(ompressed) ISAM system. To enable it, specify "isam: c" in the
configuration file. The resulting register without "storeKeys" is about
half the size, and the memory used by zebraidx during phase 2 (merge) is
reduced to a minimum.

Reworked the way Regexp-2 queries with error tolerance are handled and
specified. The documentation has been updated accordingly.

Bug fix: Zebrasrv didn't search correctly when queries contained masking
characters. This bug was introduced in 1.0a8.

Zebrasrv now tag records with the proper database name.

New settings, memMax and keyTmpDir.

Changed name of setting lockDir (previously called lockPath) and
setTmpDir (previously called tempSetPath).

Generalized and changed record type specifications. In short, there are:
       text                plain SUTRS
       grs.sgml            structured, "SGML-like" syntax
       grs.regx.<filter>   structured, Regular expression filter
       grs.marc.<abs>      Reads *MARC records in the ISO2709 format. <abs>
                           is the name of an abstract syntax file.                           
Bug fix: Result sets weren't sorted in operations involving boolean
operations with "ranked" operands.

--- 1.0a8 1996/6/6

Added national character-handling subsystem.

Various fixes.

Small modifications to input filters and profiles.

Added support for SOIF syntax (with private OID).

--- 1.0a7 1996/5/16

Fixed buffer-size problem in indexing.

Added compression to temporary files for updating.

Added phrase registers.

Added dynamic mapping of search attribute to multiple termlists (ANY).

Scan support in multiple databases/registers.

Configuration settings are case-insensitive and single dash (-)
characters are ignored in comparisons.

The index processing ignores empty files - warning given.

New option to zebraidx (-V) displays version information.

--- 1.0a6 1996/2/24

Fixed problem in file-update system.

Fixed problem in shadow system; register was sometimes corrupted after
a commit operation.

--- 1.0a5 1996/2/10

Fixed problems in the ISAM subsystem. Caused difficulties when updating
existing registers.

Fixed small problem in SUTRS-filter. A newline was sometimes inserted before
the rank and record number.

Fixed bug in the isam subsystem - caused a malfunction when accessing
words which occurred more than 10000 times.

Distribution should now include YAZ (Z39.50 protocol stack) to simplify
installation.

Server can now run under inetd. Use option -i, and -w <directory> to
set working directory to desired location.

New zebraidx command: clean - removes temporary shadow files.

Fixed bug in ISAM system. Occurred rarely during register updates.

Logging during index merge phase is improved. The remaining running
time is estimated.

Temporary files generated by zebraidx are removed after each run.

Bug fix: Dictionary didn't handle 8-bit characters correctly; was obvious
when doing scan operations in dictionaries with European characters.

--- 1.0a4 1996/01/11

A whole slew of updates, to make the first publicized release. Get the doc
and check it out.

--- 1.0a3 1995/12/06

Memory-problems in ISAM fixed. More blocktypes added to the default setup
to increase performance on larger databases.

Various minor changes in data management system.

--- 1.0a2 1995/12/05

A couple of portability-problems resolved.

Changed some malloc() to xmalloc().
