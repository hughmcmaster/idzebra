Reduced disk space for saved keys (storeKeys = 1).

Implemented proximity operator in search.

Bug fix: the path name buffers used by file match traversal routines
have been extended to support long file names.

New C(ompressed) ISAM system. To enable it, specify "isam: c" in the
configuration file. The resulting register without "storeKeys" is about
half the size, and the memory used by zebraidx during phase 2 (merge) is
reduced to a minimum.

Reworked the way Regexp-2 queries with error tolerance are handled and
specified. The documentation has been updated accordingly.

Bug fix: Zebrasrv didn't search correctly when queries contained masking
characters. This bug was introduced in 1.0a8.

Zebrasrv now tag records with the proper database name.

New settings, memMax and keyTmpDir.

Changed name of setting lockDir (previously called lockPath) and
setTmpDir (previously called tempSetPath).

Generalized and changed record type specifications. In short, there are:
       text                plain SUTRS
       grs.sgml            structured, "SGML-like" syntax
       grs.regx.<filter>   structured, Regular expression filter

Bug fix: Result sets weren't sorted in operations involving boolean
operations with "ranked" operands.

--- 1.0a8 1996/6/6

Added national character-handling subsystem.

Various fixes.

Small modifications to input filters and profiles.

Added support for SOIF syntax (with private OID).

--- 1.0a7 1996/5/16

Fixed buffer-size problem in indexing.

Added compression to temporary files for updating.

Added phrase registers.

Added dynamic mapping of search attribute to multiple termlists (ANY).

Scan support in multiple databases/registers.

Configuration settings are case-insensitive and single dash (-)
characters are ignored in comparisons.

The index processing ignores empty files - warning given.

New option to zebraidx (-V) displays version information.

--- 1.0a6 1996/2/24

Fixed problem in file-update system.

Fixed problem in shadow system; register was sometimes corrupted after
a commit operation.

--- 1.0a5 1996/2/10

Fixed problems in the ISAM subsystem. Caused difficulties when updating
existing registers.

Fixed small problem in SUTRS-filter. A newline was sometimes inserted before
the rank and record number.

Fixed bug in the isam subsystem - caused a malfunction when accessing
words which occurred more than 10000 times.

Distribution should now include YAZ (Z39.50 protocol stack) to simplify
installation.

Server can now run under inetd. Use option -i, and -w <directory> to
set working directory to desired location.

New zebraidx command: clean - removes temporary shadow files.

Fixed bug in ISAM system. Occurred rarely during register updates.

Logging during index merge phase is improved. The remaining running
time is estimated.

Temporary files generated by zebraidx are removed after each run.

Bug fix: Dictionary didn't handle 8-bit characters correctly; was obvious
when doing scan operations in dictionaries with European characters.

--- 1.0a4 1996/01/11

A whole slew of updates, to make the first publicized release. Get the doc
and check it out.

--- 1.0a3 1995/12/06

Memory-problems in ISAM fixed. More blocktypes added to the default setup
to increase performance on larger databases.

Various minor changes in data management system.

--- 1.0a2 1995/12/05

A couple of portability-problems resolved.

Changed some malloc() to xmalloc().

--- 1.0a1 1995/11/28

First release.
