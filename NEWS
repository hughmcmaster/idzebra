--- 2.0.0 2006/08/10

New record filter (record type) alvis which uses XSLT to drive both
indexing as well as retrieval. 

isamb is now the default ISAM system. In Zebra 1.3, the default ISAM was
isamc. The type used can still be configured with the 'isam' setting
in zebra.cfg.

Index structure is now 64-bit based. No more 2GB limits.

Extended search result tuning. Approximate limit for terms can be enabled
and specified with attribute 11. The (approx or exact) hit count is returned
as part of the search response as in 1.3 series. The subqueryID of a search
term hit count can be specified with attribute 10.

Zebra uses string attributes for indexing internally. Using set+numeric
use attribute can still be used. But that is a search-only conversion which
inspects .att-set files as indicated using attset-directives in zebra.cfg.
attset references are no longer required, but when used they deserve
as "check" for that the index names used are also present in .att.

Zebra record filters (record type handlers) may be built as loadable
modules (.so's) on Unix. In particular the Zebra 2.0 Debian package uses
separate packages for each of them. This also means that zebra programs
such as zebraidx is no longer depending on Tcl/other..

Documentation updates, especially on queries, SRU, XSLT support.
