--- 2.0.0 2006/08/10

New record filter (record type) 'alvis' which uses XSLT transformations
to drive both indexing as well as retrieval. See example configuration in the
'example/alvis-oai' directory.

'isamb' is now the default ISAM system. In Zebra 1.3, the default ISAM was
'isamc'. The type used can still be configured with the 'isam' setting
in 'zebra.cfg'.

Index structure is now 64-bit based, also on 32 bit systems. 
There are no more 2GB register file limits.

Extended search result tuning. Approximate limit for terms can be enabled
and specified with attribute 11. The (approx or exact) hit count is returned
as part of the search response as in 1.3 series. The subqueryID of a search
term hit count can be specified with attribute 10.

Zebra uses string attributes for indexing internally. Using set+numeric
use attribute can still be used. This is a search-only conversion which
inspects '*.att'-set files as indicated using attset-directives in 'zebra.cfg'.
'attset' references are no longer required, but when used they deserve
as "check" for that the index names used are also present in '*.att'.

Zebra record filters (record type handlers) may be built as loadable
modules (.so's) on Unix. In particular the Zebra 2.0 Debian package uses
separate packages for each of them. This also means that zebra programs
such as zebraidx is no longer depending on Tcl/other..

Documentation updates, especially on query structure and syntax, SRU, 
XSLT support, alvis filter module, and many added examples.

Improved logging of the 'zebrasrv' and 'zebraidx' binaries.

Improved debian package structure.
