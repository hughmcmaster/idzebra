This example shows how a Zebra server can act as an XML repository and
search engine with the absolute minimum of configuration.  The data
used here is description of dinosaur genera, taken from Michael
Keesey's wonderful reference web-site, the Dinosauricon at
	http://dinosauricon.com/

As though making the site itself freely available weren't enough, Mike
also offers the raw XML data from which the site's built.  I've
hand-hacked the files slightly to get them into a form that Zebra is
happy with, but the data itself is entirely due to him.  You can
always get the up-to-date version from
	http://dinosauricon.com/data/
