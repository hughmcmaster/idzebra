The Library of Congress' Network Development and MARC Standards Office
is developing a framework for working with MARC data in a XML
environment. This framework is intended to be flexible and extensible
to allow users to work with MARC data in ways specific to their
needs. The framework itself includes many components such as schemas,
stylesheets, and software tools.
