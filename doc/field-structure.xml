  <title>Field Structure and Character Sets
  </title>
  
  <para>
   In order to provide a flexible approach to national character set
   handling, Zebra allows the administrator to configure the set up the
   system to handle any 8-bit character set &mdash; including sets that
   require multi-octet diacritics or other multi-octet characters. The
   definition of a character set includes a specification of the
   permissible values, their sort order (this affects the display in the
   SCAN function), and relationships between upper- and lowercase
   characters. Finally, the definition includes the specification of
   space characters for the set.
  </para>

  <para>
   The operator can define different character sets for different fields,
   typical examples being standard text fields, numerical fields, and
   special-purpose fields such as WWW-style linkages (URx).
  </para>

  <section id="default-idx-file">
   <title>The default.idx file</title>
   <para>
    The field types, and hence character sets, are associated with data
    elements by the .abs files (see above).
    The file <literal>default.idx</literal>
    provides the association between field type codes (as used in the .abs
    files) and the character map files (with the .chr suffix). The format
    of the .idx file is as follows
   </para>

   <para>
    <variablelist>

     <varlistentry>
      <term>index <replaceable>field type code</replaceable></term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
	This directive introduces a new search index code.
	The argument is a one-character code to be used in the
	.abs files to select this particular index type. An index, roughly,
	corresponds to a particular structure attribute during search. Refer
	to <xref linkend="zebrasrv-search"/>.
       </para>
      </listitem></varlistentry>
     <varlistentry>
      <term>sort <replaceable>field code type</replaceable></term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
	This directive introduces a 
	sort index. The argument is a one-character code to be used in the
	.abs fie to select this particular index type. The corresponding
	use attribute must be used in the sort request to refer to this
	particular sort index. The corresponding character map (see below)
	is used in the sort process.
       </para>
      </listitem></varlistentry>
     <varlistentry>
      <term>completeness <replaceable>boolean</replaceable></term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
	This directive enables or disables complete field indexing.
	The value of the <replaceable>boolean</replaceable> should be 0
	(disable) or 1. If completeness is enabled, the index entry will
	contain the complete contents of the field (up to a limit), with words
	(non-space characters) separated by single space characters
	(normalized to " " on display). When completeness is
	disabled, each word is indexed as a separate entry. Complete subfield
	indexing is most useful for fields which are typically browsed (eg.
	titles, authors, or subjects), or instances where a match on a
	complete subfield is essential (eg. exact title searching). For fields
	where completeness is disabled, the search engine will interpret a
	search containing space characters as a word proximity search.

      <term>lowercase <replaceable>value-set</replaceable></term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
	This directive introduces the basic value set of the field type.
	The format is an ordered list (without spaces) of the
	characters which may occur in "words" of the given type.
	The order of the entries in the list determines the
	sort order of the index. In addition to single characters, the
	following combinations are legal:
       </para>

       <para>

	<itemizedlist>
	 <listitem>
	  <para>
	   Backslashes may be used to introduce three-digit octal, or
	   two-digit hex representations of single characters
	   (preceded by <literal>x</literal>).
	   In addition, the combinations
	   \\, \\r, \\n, \\t, \\s (space &mdash; remember that real
	   space-characters may not occur in the value definition), and
	   \\ are recognized, with their usual interpretation.
	  </para>
	 </listitem>

	 <listitem>
	  <para>
	   Curly braces {} may be used to enclose ranges of single
	   characters (possibly using the escape convention described in the
	   preceding point), eg. {a-z} to introduce the
	   standard range of ASCII characters.
	   Note that the interpretation of such a range depends on
	   the concrete representation in your local, physical character set.
	  </para>
	 </listitem>

	 <listitem>
	  <para>
	   paranthesises () may be used to enclose multi-byte characters -
	   eg. diacritics or special national combinations (eg. Spanish
	   "ll"). When found in the input stream (or a search term),
	   these characters are viewed and sorted as a single character, with a
	   sorting value depending on the position of the group in the value
	   statement.
	  </para>
	 </listitem>

	</itemizedlist>

       </para>
       <para>
        For example, <literal>scan.chr</literal> contains the following
        lowercase normalization and sorting order:
        <screen>
         lowercase {0-9}{a-y}üzæäøöå
        </screen>
       </para>
      </listitem></varlistentry>
     <varlistentry>
      <term>uppercase <replaceable>value-set</replaceable></term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
	This directive introduces the
	upper-case equivalences to the value set (if any). The number and
	order of the entries in the list should be the same as in the
	<literal>lowercase</literal> directive.
       </para>
       <para>
        For example, <literal>scan.chr</literal> contains the following
        uppercase equivalent:
        <screen>
         uppercase {0-9}{A-Y}ÜZÆÄØÖÅ
        </screen>
       </para>
      </listitem></varlistentry>
     <varlistentry>
      <term>space <replaceable>value-set</replaceable></term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
	This directive introduces the character
	which separate words in the input stream. Depending on the
	completeness mode of the field in question, these characters either
	terminate an index entry, or delimit individual "words" in
	the input stream. The order of the elements is not significant &mdash;
	otherwise the representation is the same as for the
	<literal>uppercase</literal> and <literal>lowercase</literal>
	directives.
       </para>
       <para>
        For example, <literal>scan.chr</literal> contains the following
        space instruction:
        <screen><![CDATA[
         space {\001-\040}!"#$%&'\()*+,-./:;<=>?@\[\\]^_`\{|}~
        ]]></screen>
       </para>
      </listitem></varlistentry>
     <varlistentry>
      <term>map <replaceable>value-set</replaceable>
       <replaceable>target</replaceable></term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
	This directive introduces a mapping between each of the
	members of the value-set on the left to the character on the
	right. The character on the right must occur in the value
	set (the <literal>lowercase</literal> directive) of the
	character set, but it may be a parenthesis-enclosed
	multi-octet character. This directive may be used to map
	diacritics to their base characters, or to map HTML-style
	character-representations to their natural form, etc. The
	map directive can also be used to ignore leading articles in
	searching and/or sorting, and to perform other special
	transformations. See section <xref
	 linkend="leading-articles"/>.
       </para>
       <para>
        For example, <literal>scan.chr</literal> contains the following
        map instructions among others, to make sure that HTML entity
        encoded  Danish special characters are mapped to the
        equivalent Latin-1 characters:
        <screen><![CDATA[
         map (&aelig;)      æ
         map (&oslash;)     ø
         map (&aring;)      å
        ]]></screen>
       </para>
      </listitem></varlistentry>
     <varlistentry>
      <term>equivalent <replaceable>value-set</replaceable></term>
      <listitem>
       <para>
	This directive introduces equivalence classes of characters
	and/or strings for sorting purposes only. It resembles the map
	directive, but does not affect search and retrieval indexing,
	but only sorting order under present requests. 
       </para>
       <para>
        For example, <literal>scan.chr</literal> contains the following
        equivalent sorting instructions, which can be uncommented:
        <screen><![CDATA[
         # equivalent æä(ae)
         # equivalent øö(oe)
         # equivalent å(aa)
         # equivalent uü
        ]]></screen>
       </para>
      </listitem></varlistentry>
    </variablelist>
   </para>
  </section>
  <section id="leading-articles">
   <title>Ignoring leading articles</title>
   <para>
    In addition to specifying sort orders, space (blank) handling,
    and upper/lowercase folding, you can also use the character map
    files to make Zebra ignore leading articles in sorting records,
    or when doing complete field searching.
   </para>
   <para>
    This is done using the <literal>map</literal> directive in the
    character map file. In a nutshell, what you do is map certain
    sequences of characters, when they occur <emphasis> in the
     beginning of a field</emphasis>, to a space. Assuming that the
    character "@" is defined as a space character in your file, you
    can do:
    <screen>
     map (^The\s) @
     map (^the\s) @
    </screen>
    The effect of these directives is to map either 'the' or 'The',
    followed by a space character, to a space. The hat ^ character
    denotes beginning-of-field only when complete-subfield indexing
    or sort indexing is taking place; otherwise, it is treated just
    as any other character.
   </para>
   <para>
    Because the <literal>default.idx</literal> file can be used to
    associate different character maps with different indexing types
    -- and you can create additional indexing types, should the need
    arise -- it is possible to specify that leading articles should
    be ignored either in sorting, in complete-field searching, or
    both.
   </para>
   <para>
    If you ignore certain prefixes in sorting, then these will be
    eliminated from the index, and sorting will take place as if
    they weren't there. However, if you set the system up to ignore
    certain prefixes in <emphasis>searching</emphasis>, then these
    are deleted both from the indexes and from query terms, when the
    client specifies complete-field searching. This has the effect
    that a search for 'the science journal' and 'science journal'
    would both produce the same results.
