Hi,

I finished first steps to use Zebra as fulltext engine for Harvest
(http://harvest.sourceforge.net/). The performance boost after
some testing are quite impressive.

Here is my article I wrote for the Harvest mailinglist.

Many thanks for Zebra.

------------------------------------------------------
Hi,

The first results after some testing with Zebra are very promising.

The tests were done with around 220 000 SOIF files, which occupies
1.6GB of disk space.

Building the index from scratch takes around one hour with Zebra where
Glimpse needs around five hours.

While glimpse blocks search requests when updating its index, Zebra
can still answer search requests.

While the search time of glimpse varies from some seconds to some
minutes depending how expensive the query is, Zebra usually takes
around one to three seconds, even for expensive queries.

Glimpse' index occupies around 250MB of disk space, Zebra's index
takes around 570MB.

Zebra supports incremental indexing which will speed up indexing even
further.

There are still potential for faster searches when necessary, using
tweaks on apache.

On the other hand, modeling data is not complete, yet.

To sum it up:
- Zebra indexes data five times faster than Glimpse
- Zebra doesn't cause downtimes for indexupdate
- Zebra's search time doesn't jump from seconds to minutes for no
  obvious reason, but stays constant within a range of one to three
  seconds
- Zebra can search more than 100 times faster than Glimpse
- Zebra can process multiple search requests simultaneously
- Zebra can speed up indexing by using incremental indexing
- Glimpse's index size is only around half of the Zebra's index

Hi K-J,

It's nice to read all this good stuff about Zebra!  I'm currently
working on changes to the documentation for the next Zebra release,
and I'd love to include a lightly-edited version of your message in
the new document.  (Basically, I'd obscure the name of your old
engine, so it's clear that we're trying to say good things about Zebra
rather than score points off a competitor.)  Would it be OK for me to
quote you?  If yes in principle, then I'll run the actual wording past
you before submitting it.

Thanks,

You are welcome to do this.

I am very happy to see such a nice software available under GPL.

Thanks.
