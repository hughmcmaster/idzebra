  <para>
   <ulink url="http://indexdata.dk/zebra/">Zebra</ulink>
   is a high-performance, general-purpose structured text
   indexing and retrieval engine. It reads records in a
   variety of input formats (eg. email, XML, MARC) and provides access
   to them through a powerful combination of boolean search
   expressions and relevance-ranked free-text queries.
  </para>

  <para>
   Zebra supports large databases (tens of millions of records,
   tens of gigabytes of data). It allows safe, incremental
   database updates on live systems. Because Zebra supports
   the industry-standard information retrieval protocol, Z39.50,
   you can search Zebra databases using an enormous variety of
   programs and toolkits, both commercial and free, which understand
   this protocol.  Application libraries are available to allow
   bespoke clients to be written in Perl, C, C++, Java, Tcl, Visual
   Basic, Python, PHP and more - see the
   <ulink url="&url.zoom;">ZOOM web site</ulink>
   for more information on some of these client toolkits.
  </para>

  <para>
   This document is an introduction to the Zebra system. It explains
   how to compile the software, how to prepare your first database,
   and how to configure the server to give you the
   functionality that you need.

  <title>References and Zebra based Applications</title>
  <para>
   Zebra has been deployed in numerous applications, in both the
   academic and commercial worlds, in application domains as diverse
   as bibliographic catalogues, geospatial information, structured
   vocabulary browsing, government information locators, civic
   information systems, environmental observations, museum information
   and web indexes.
  </para>
  <para>
   Notable applications include the following:
  </para>


  <section id="koha-ils">
   <title>Koha free open-source ILS</title>
   <para>
     <ulink url="http://www.koha.org/">Koha</ulink> is a full-featured
     open-source ILS, initially developed  in 
     New Zealand by Katipo Communications Ltd, and first deployed in
     January of 2000 for Horowhenua Library Trust. It is currently
     maintained by a team of software providers and library technology
     staff from around the globe. 
    </para>
    <para>
     <ulink url="http://liblime.com/">LibLime</ulink>, 
     a company that is marketing and supporting Koha, adds in
     the new release of Koha 3.0 the Zebra
     database server to drive its bibliographic database.
    </para>
    <para>
     In early 2005, the Koha project development team began looking at
     ways to improve MARC support and overcome scalability limitations
     in the Koha 2.x series. After extensive evaluations of the best
     of the Open Source textual database engines - including MySQL
     full-text searching, PostgreSQL, Lucene and Plucene - the team
     selected Zebra. 
    </para>
    <para>
     "Zebra completely eliminates scalability limitations, because it
     can support tens of millions of records." explained Joshua
     Ferraro, LibLime's Technology President and Koha's Project
     Release Manager. "Our performance tests showed search results in
     under a second for databases with over 5 million records on a
     modest i386 900Mhz test server." 
    </para>
    <para>
     "Zebra also includes support for true boolean search expressions
     and relevance-ranked free-text queries, both of which the Koha
     2.x series lack. Zebra also supports incremental and safe
     database updates, which allow on-the-fly record
     management. Finally, since Zebra has at its heart the Z39.50
     protocol, it greatly improves Koha's support for that critical
     library standard." 
    </para>
    <para> 
     Although the bibliographic database will be moved to Zebra, Koha
     3.0 will continue to use a relational SQL-based database design
     for the 'factual' database. "Relational database managers have
     their strengths, in spite of their inability to handle large
     numbers of bibliographic records efficiently," summed up Ferraro,
     "We're taking the best from both worlds in our redesigned Koha
     3.0.

   <title>Various web indexes</title>
   <para>
    Zebra has been used by a variety of institutions to construct
    indexes of large web sites, typically in the region of tens of
    millions of pages.  In this role, it functions somewhat similarly
    to the engine of google or altavista, but for a selected intranet
    or a subset of the whole Web.

   <para>
    For example, Liverpool University's web-search facility (see on

   <para>
    Kang-Jin Lee
    has recently modified the Harvest web indexer to use Zebra as
    its native repository engine.  His comments on the switch over
    from the old engine are revealing:
    <blockquote>
     <para>
      The first results after some testing with Zebra are very
      promising.  The tests were done with around 220,000 SOIF files,
      which occupies 1.6GB of disk space.
     </para>
     <para>
      Building the index from scratch takes around one hour with Zebra
      where [old-engine] needs around five hours.  While [old-engine]
      blocks search requests when updating its index, Zebra can still
      answer search requests.
      [...]
      Zebra supports incremental indexing which will speed up indexing
      even further.
     </para>
     <para>
      While the search time of [old-engine] varies from some seconds
      to some minutes depending how expensive the query is, Zebra
      usually takes around one to three seconds, even for expensive
      queries.
      [...]
      Zebra can search more than 100 times faster than [old-engine]
      and can process multiple search requests simultaneously

      I am very happy to see such nice software available under GPL.

   <title>Support</title>
   <para>
    You can get support for Zebra from at least three sources.
   </para>
   <para>
    First, there's the Zebra web site at
    <ulink url="&url.idzebra;"/>,
     which always has the most recent version available for download.
     If you have a problem with Zebra, the first thing to do is see
     whether it's fixed in the current release.
   </para>
   <para>
    Second, there's the Zebra mailing list.  Its home page at
    <ulink url="&url.idzebra.mailinglist;"/>
     includes a complete archive of all messages that have ever been
     posted on the list.  The Zebra mailing list is used both for
     announcements from the authors (new
     releases, bug fixes, etc.) and general discussion.  You are welcome
     to seek support there.  Join by filling the form on the list home page.
   </para>
   <para>
    Third, it's possible to buy a commercial support contract, with
    well defined service levels and response times, from Index Data.

       Improved support for XML in search and retrieval. Eventually,
       the goal is for Zebra to pull double duty as a flexible
       information retrieval engine and high-performance XML
       repository.  The recent addition of XPath searching is one
       example of the kind of enhancement we're working on.

       There is also the experimental <literal>ALVIS XSLT</literal>
       XML input filter, which unleashes the full power of DOM based
       XSLT transformations during indexing and record retrieval. Work
       on this filter has been sponsored by the ALVIS EU project
       <ulink url="http://www.alvis.info/alvis/"/>. We expect this filter to
       mature soon, as it is planned to be included in the version 2.0
       release of Zebra.

       Finalisation and documentation of Zebra's C programming
       API, allowing updates, database management and other functions
       not readily expressed in Z39.50.  We will also consider
       exposing the API through SOAP.

       Improved free-text searching. We're first and foremost octet jockeys and
       we're actively looking for organisations or people who'd like
       to contribute experience in relevance ranking and text
       searching.
