     Zebra</ulink>
   is a high-performance, general-purpose structured text
   indexing and retrieval engine. It reads structured records in a
   variety of input formats (eg. email, XML, MARC) and allows access
   to them through exact boolean search expressions and
   relevance-ranked free-text queries.
   </para>

   <para>
   Zebra supports large databases (more than ten gigabytes of data,
   tens of millions of records). It supports safe, incremental
   database updates on live systems. You can access data stored in
   Zebra using a variety of Index Data tools (eg. YAZ and PHP/YAZ) as
   well as commercial and freeware Z39.50 clients and toolkits. 
   </para>

  <para>
   This document is an introduction to the Zebra system. It will tell you
   how to compile the software, and how to prepare your first database.
   It also explains how the server can be configured to give you the
   functionality that you need.

  <title>Features</title>
  
  <para>
   This is an overview of some of the most important features of the
   system.
  </para>
  
  <para>
   <itemizedlist>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Supports large databases - files for indices, etc. can be
      automatically partitioned over multiple disks.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Supports arbitrarily complex records - base input format is an
      SGML-like syntax which allows nested (structured) data elements, as
      well as variant forms of data.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Robust updating - records can be added and deleted without
      rebuilding the index from scratch.
      The update procedure is tolerant to crashes or hard interrupts
      during register updating - registers can be reconstructed following
      a crash.
      Registers can be safely updated even while users are accessing
      the server.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Supports random storage formats. A system of input filters driven by
      regular expressions allows you to easily process most ASCII-based
      data formats. SGML, XML, ISO2709 (MARC), and raw text are also
      supported.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>     
     <para>
      Supports boolean queries as well as relevance-ranking (free-text)
      searching. Right truncation and masking in terms are supported, as
      well as full regular expressions.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>
        Can import the data into Zebras own storage, or just refer to
        external files (good for building indexes of "live"
	collections).
      </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Supports multiple concrete syntaxes
      for record exchange (depending on the configuration): GRS-1, SUTRS,
      XML, ISO2709 (*MARC). Records can be mapped between record syntaxes
      and schema on the fly.      
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>     
     <para>
      Supports approximate matching in registers (ie. spelling mistakes,
      etc).
     </para>
    </listitem>
    
    <listitem>
     <para>
      Zebra is written in portable C, so it runs on most Unix-like systems 
      as well as Windows NT - a binary distribution for Windows NT is available.

      Piggy-backed presents are honored in the search-request.

      Named result sets are supported.
     </para>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Easily configured to support different application profiles, with
      tables for attribute sets, tag sets, and abstract syntaxes.
      Additional tables control facilities such as element mappings to
      different schema (eg., GILS-to-USMARC).
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Complex composition specifications using Espec-1 are partially
      supported (simple element requests only).
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
      Element Set Names are defined using the Espec-1 capability of the
      system, and are given in configuration files as simple element
      requests (and possibly variant requests).

  <title>Applications</title>
  <para>
   Zebra has been deployed in numerous applications, in both the
   academic and commercial worlds, in application domains as diverse
   as bibliographic information, geospatial, ### (Help, guys!)
  </para>
  <para>
   Notable applications include the following:
  </para>

  <sect2>
   <title>DADS - the DTV Article Database Service</title>
   <para>
    DADS is a huge database of ### records, allowing students and
    researchers at DTU (###) to search and order articles from several
    different databases at once.  The database contains
    literature on all engineering subjects.  It's available on-line
    through a web gateway at
	http://www.dtv.dk/search/index_e.htm
    though only to members of the university.
   </para>
   <para>
    ### Much more information needed.

 <sect1 id="future">
  <title>Future Work</title>
  
  <para>
   These are some of the plans that we have for the software in the near
   and far future, approximately ordered after their relative importance.
  </para>
  
  <para>
   <itemizedlist>

    <listitem>
     <para>
       Improved support for XML in search and retrieval. Eventually,
       the goal is for Zebra to pull double duty as a flexible
       information retrieval engine and high-performance XML
       repository.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
       Access to search engine through SOAP/RPC API to allow the
       construction of applications without requiring Z39.50 tools.
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
       Finalisation, documentation of the Zebra API. Consider
       exposing the API through SOAP as well (allowing updates,
       database management).
     </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
     <para>
       Improved free-text searching. We're first and foremost octet jockeys and
       we're actively looking for organisations or people who'd like
       to contribute experience in relevance ranking and text
       searching.

   Programmers thrive on user feedback. If you are interested in a
   facility that you don't see mentioned here, or if there's something
   you think we could do better, please drop us a mail.
   If you think it's all really neat, you're welcome to drop us a line
   saying that, too. You'll find contact info at the end of this file.
